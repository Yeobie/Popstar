            <p>
              Bangtan Sonyeondan (방탄소년단 - Bulletproof Boys), or BTS, are a
              South-Korean group that was formed in the early 2010s and debuted
              on June 13th, 2013. With nine studio albums, seven complilation
              albums and six extended plays, the record-breaking group is
              arguably the biggest boy idol group in the world, with many
              chart-topping hits. <br />
              BTS has strongly influenced the world with its heartfelt messages
              of consolation and hope for youth, and spoke about major subjects
              such as self-harm, academic stress, inferiority complex, bullying,
              depression, elitism, and mental health. They are the first Asian
              group to win Best Artist at the American Music Awards and first
              all Korean band to perform at the Grammy Awards and to receive a
              nomination. They were the first Korean group to win a Billboard
              Music Award, and in 2021 they collaborated with Coldplay for the
              song "My Universe". <br />
              Data suggests that the band brings over $3.9 billion to the South
              Korean economy. The Hyundai Research institute found that about
              800,000 visitors visit South Korea because of BTS every year.

              ARMY, you are our wings. <br />
              Because of you all, we can fly.” BTS
            </h2>
            <p>
              From being underdogs in the music industry (their production
              house, Big Hit Entertainment, had initially very little money) to
              becoming a record-breaking group with billions of streams, BTS
              also humbly credits their success to their fandom, the ARMY.<br />
              The ARMY members are young, liberal, international, influential,
              and masters of social media. They stand apart from other fandoms
              through the ways they have mobilized with an unrivaled level of
              organization and dedication, driven by a desire to see the seven
              members of BTS leave their mark in territories previously
              uncharted by any other pop act from South Korea. BTS fans are also
              known to have contributed to hundreds of charitable causes (saving
              more than 5000 lives, raising 1.5M for BTS UNICEF campaign,
              planting 50.000 trees etc.). BTS and Big Hit Entertainment donated
              US$1 million to Black Lives Matter, announcing they stand together
              against racial discrimination. The ARMY matched the donation in 24
              hours. <br />
              Based on the 2022 ARMY Census, there are currently more than
              500,000 ARMY in the world.

                      member of BTS. He's the one in the group who speaks

                      watching Friends) and acts as the spokesperson of BTS.
                      He's a skilled rapper (RM stands for Rap Monster) and part
                      of the group's rapline made up by the three rappers: him,
                      Suga, and <br />
                      J-Hope. Together with them, he's the writer of many of the
                      group's songs. He recently produced his first studio
                      album, "Indigo", with 'Wild Flower' as title track.

                      Born December 4th, 1992, he's the oldest member of the
                      group and part of the vocal line, made up by the four
                      vocals: him, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. Jin's laughter is
                      contagious and he's the funniest member of the group: he
                      usually makes dad jokes and he's self-proclaimed "World
                      Wide Handsome", a recurrent joke he says to make the
                      members and ARMY smile. He also loves to cook for the
                      other members. Jin recently released his single, "The
                      Astronaut", a song that was created for him by none other
                      than... Coldplay!

                      Born March 9th, 1993, Yoongi was the second member who
                      entered in the group after RM. He's an amazing rapper,
                      song-writer and composer, and also part of the group's
                      rapline. Like Jin, he likes to cook for the other members.
                      He's serious-looking and may also seem reserved and shy,
                      but when he's with his group he's very laidback and loves
                      to have fun with them. He's also a soloist: with the
                      pseudonym of Agust D, he's published two mixtapes.
                      Besides, he wrote Psy's latest success, 'That That', and
                      he performed in it too.

                      Born February 18th, 1994, he's the group main dancer and a
                      rapper: he was the third member to enter the group after
                      RM and Suga. He introduces himself by saying: "I'm your
                      hope, you're my hope, I'm J-Hope!". Faithfully to his
                      name, he acts as the positive energy glue for the team
                      with his cheerful personality; he loves goofing around and
                      making weird sounds; but he's also the best dancer and he
                      can be very strict when it comes to choreographies: the
                      other members are always nervous to make mistakes in front
                      of him! In 2022 he published his first solo album: "Jack
                      in The Box", with 'More' as title track.

                      Born October 13th, 1995, Jimin was the last member to
                      enter the group in 2012, one year before their debut. He's
                      the most skilled dancer alongside J-Hope, and his classic
                      dance moves are outstanding - he also does the solo dance
                      breaks. He loves receiving attention from fans and he's
                      very affectionate to them. He's in the vocal line and has
                      a clear, smooth, falsetto voice that often sounds feminine
                      but can also turn masculine when he growls. His solo songs
                      really deliver all the potential of his voice - for
                      example, the song 'Serendipity'.

                      Born December 30th, 1995, Taehyung entered the group at
                      the end of 2011 and he's one of the members of the vocal
                      line. BTS' and ARMY's official color is purple and it's
                      thanks to him: at the end of a concert, he said "I purple
                      you. Do you know what purple means? Purple is the last
                      color of the rainbow so it means I will trust and love you
                      for a long time." He's kind, generous, playful with the
                      members and very affectionate to them - he's prone to
                      skinship and hugs them a lot. He loves jazz music, likes
                      to dress elegantly or in a vintage style and has a deep,
                      soothing, soulful baritone voice that you can enjoy in
                      songs such as 'Singularity'.

                      ('maknae') of the group, and he joined them (choosing Big
                      Hit over 7 other agencies) after listening to RM's rap and
                      falling in love with it. He's in the vocal line. He has a
                      kind heart, deeply loves his fans, and everyone calls him
                      'Golden Maknae' because he's multi-talented: he has an
                      incredible voice but he's also a great dancer, has strong
                      physical abilities and he's also good at painting. He gets
                      the majorities of the solos and is the front lead dancer.
                      One of his most famous solos is 'Euphoria', where you can
                      really get a clear idea of the high notes he can reach
                      with his voice.
